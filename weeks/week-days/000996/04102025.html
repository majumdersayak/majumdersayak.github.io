                        As always, it was hard to get started, but I'll do it.

                        Crypto-graphy, is such a powerful thing, literally, hide this section, there's nothing sensitive here, but to learn, how I can do it I did this. Normally, nobody should found this section, unless they know, it even exist and then they must know the passkey. Coding is literally teaching me, you can do whatever you can, if you think, OMG!

                        It's 11:25 now, & I'm going to start working on today's goals, Now will take shower, and do 216 times Jap & then will start SBC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Uff! Again wasted some time by simply editing the site, shouldn't do it! Now will complete the puja first, let's go!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Day time Puja Done! It's really feels great after breaking the barrier of 108 times for the first time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I took a nap this afternoon for a few hours, and now I’m honestly amazed,  my brain and body are ready to do everything except study. I've to break this. I'm inside a loop, nothing is in my control, I've to break this freaking loop. Sayak, you're the owner of your life, & nobody cares man, please understand, and study, simply open the book and teach yourself the concepts. Lock in and study until you passout, you've to be totally obsessed, don't think just act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just look at me, it's 9:00 pm, not able to start till now, the SBC! Fuck
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've to meet with my demons, from tomorrow, will also start physical, but will do it, no matter what, today atleast let's complete the Spiritual Goal.
